# This is an example of dummy packages that can be created to transition to
#   new packages. This file could (but wasn't) be dropped in the 
#   debian/control.d/transitions to create packages that would migrate users
#   to a new default kernel package. To do this, one cannot have the packages
#   conflict and replace, as has been done in the past. In the future, this is
#   probably the preferred technique instead.
