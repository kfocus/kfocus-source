# This overrides /etc/initramfs-tools/initramfs.conf.
# See that file for the detailed meaning of each setting.

# Modules:
# One can minimize initrd size by pulling in only dependent modules.
# However, this can break plugable peripherals and eGPU support.
# Therefore, we stick with the default which is 'most'.

# MODULES=dep

# Compression:
# kfocus had made initrd smaller by using xz compression to
#  compensate for a initrd image too large bug (#3522),
#  bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1842320).
#  This is fixed as of 2023-05. Reverting decreases boot time
#  and update times.
