FocusRx: KERNEL CLEANER
Doc: https://kfocus.org/wf/tools#kclean

2 kernels are installed.
Check forced: /boot space is low (139 of 705 MB).

Disk space on /boot is low, but only protected 
kernel are installed. If there is a kernel you 
are NOT USING, we encourage you to purge it so 
the /boot disk does not overfill and prevent the
system from booting.

=== BEGIN Intention ==============
_001 Installed kernels are
6.5.0-14-generic (generic-hwe-22.04-kfocus),
6.2.0-35-generic.
- Running kernel is 6.5.0-14-generic per assert.
- Blessed kernel is 6.5.0-14-generic because meta installed per assert.
- /boot is its own partition with 139 free of 705M.
- Check Forced: Low disk space (139 < 200 reserved for kernels)
- Results in NO PURGE because a minimum of 2 kernels is preserved.
 -- HOWEVER, a warning for low disk should be shown.
