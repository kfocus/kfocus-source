.001 Installed kernels are 6.5.0-14-generic, 6.2.0-35-generic.
- Running kernel is 6.5.0-14-generic per this test.
- Blessed kernel is 6.5.0-14-generic per mock.
- /boot is its own partition with 139 free of 705M.
- Check Forced: Low disk space (139 < 200 reserved for kernels)
- Results in NO PURGE because a minimum of 2 kernels is preserved.
 -- HOWEVER, a warning for low disk should be shown.

FocusRx: KERNEL CLEANER
Doc: https://kfocus.org/wf/tools#kclean

2 kernels are installed.
The /boot directory has 139 of 705M available.
Check forced: /boot space is low.

Disk space on /boot is low, but 
only protected kernel are installed.

If you have a kernel you are not using,
purge it to increase available space.

Otherwise, /boot could overfill during a 
kernel upgrade which could prevent normal 
booting of the system.
