_024 Installed kernels are
6.8.0-31-generic,
6.8.0-35-generic (UNSIGNED!),
6.8.0-35-kfocus (UNSIGNED!),
6.8.0-36-kfocus (UNSIGNED!).
- Running kernel is 6.8.0-36-kfocus per assert.
- Blessed kernel is 6.8.0-36-kfocus because meta installed per assert.
- /boot is on separate partition with 2000M free.
- NO PURGE, because...
-- There is enough room for several more kernels (2000M > 230M)
-- This is NOT low space when total space allows (2600/230 = 11) kernels
