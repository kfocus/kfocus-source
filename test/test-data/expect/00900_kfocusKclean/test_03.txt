.003 Installed kernels are
 6.5.0-14 (generic-hwe-22.04-kfocus), 6.2.0-35-generic.
- Running kernel is 6.5.0-14-generic per this assert.
- Blessed kernel is 6.5.0-14-generic per mock.
- /boot is its own partition with 297 free of 705M.
- Check NOT Forced: Enough disk space
- Results in no action BECAUSE:
-- There is enough room for one more kernel (297M > 200M)
-- This is NOT low space when total space allows (705/200 = 3) kernels
