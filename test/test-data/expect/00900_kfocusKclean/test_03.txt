.003 Installed kernels are 6.5.0-14, 6.2.0-35-generic.
- Running kernel is 6.5.0-14-generic per this test.
- Blessed kernel is 6.5.0-14-generic per mock.
- /boot is its own partition with 297 free of 705M.
- Results in no action BECAUSE
-- There is enough room for one more kernel (297M > 200M)
-- This is NOT low space when total space allows (705/200 = 3) kernels
