.004 Installed Kernels are
6.5.0-14 (generic-hwe-22.04-kfocus), 6.2.0-35-generic.
- Running kernel is 6.5.0-14-generic per this assert.
- Blessed kernel is 6.5.0-14-generic per mock.
- /boot is its own partition with 297 free of 705M.
- Run is forced by -f flag.
- Results in no purge offered BECAUSE:
-- There is enough room for one more kernel (297M > 200M)
-- This is NOT low space when total space allows (705/200 = 3) kernels
 -- HOWEVER, a report is presented due to force flag.
