=== BEGIN Intention ==============
_009 Installed kernels are
6.5.0-21-generic (generic-hwe-22.04),
6.5.0-17-generic,
6.5.0-14-generic (generic-hwe-22.04-kfocus) (meta purged).
- Running kernel is 6.5.0-21-generic (generic-hwe-22.04) per assert.
- Blessed kernel is NOT FOUND because meta not installed per assert.
- /boot is its own partition with 1482 free of 2048M.
- Results in no action BECAUSE:
-- There is enough room for many more kernels (1482 > 230M), around 6x
-- Enough disk space is present to permit 8 kernels to be installed.
-- The target keep number is greater than installed, 5 > 3
