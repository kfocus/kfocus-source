# You may remove the package 'kfocus-nvidia' to remove this file;
#   however, doing so will adjust the mix of nvidia driver libs
#   which may prevent the deep-learning suite ('kfocus-conda'),
#   compute, and other ML tasks from working as expected.

# IMPORTANT! THIS MUST COME BEFORE the nvidia-* match below to work.
#   Use NVIDIA supplied version 535.* of nvidia-settings or
#   nvidia-modprobe from NVIDIA ONLY if these are not available from the
#   Jammy repositry (Prioriy 1000 < 1001, below). The package cuda-drivers-535.*
#   requires these versions.

# Pin cuda-drivers to use version 535.54.* because we found sometimes later
#   version to require newer packages not available in ubuntu repo. This was
#   last updated on 2023-07-05, and 535.54 is the latest cuda-drivers version
#   on that date. The 1001 Priority causes a version to be installed even if
#   does not come from the target release ('Focal' or 'Jammy') and forces
#   a downgrade if required.

# Prefer all cuda* 535 packages from NVIDIA over any Ubuntu packages of the

#   The 1000 Priority causes a new version from this origin to be installed

#   target release specification, and the 1000 Priority forces a downgrade
#   and prevents packages from proceeding beyond 535.
