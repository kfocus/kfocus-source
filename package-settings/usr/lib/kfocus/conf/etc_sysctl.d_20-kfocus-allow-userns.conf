# Ubuntu 24.04 restricts the use of unprivileged user namespaces, which can
# cause significant problems (i.e., crashes) with certain applications that
# use sandboxing. Affected applications include any AppImages that make use
# of Electron (balenaEtcher being a prominent example). For the time being,
# this is unacceptable for KFocus machines, and this restriction has been
# disabled as a result.
