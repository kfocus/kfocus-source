.SS Interactive Use
.PP

.SH OTHER NOTES
.PP
This kfocus-qwe package automatically installs a symlink from
\f[C]/usr/share/qwe/qwe.source\f[R] to
\f[C]/etc/bash_completion.d/qwe\f[R].
If qwe is not desired system-wide, one may delete this symlink and add
\f[C]source /usr/share/qwe/qwe.source\f[R] in .bashrc.
.PP
One can add qwe system-wide by adding a symlink from
\f[C]qwe.source\f[R] to \f[C]/etc/bash_completion.d/qwe\f[R].
.PP
Bookmarks are stored in a tab-delimited file called
\f[C]/.qwe.data\f[R].
The \f[C]$HOME\f[R] directory is parameterized so this file can be
shared by multiple users.
