.SS Packaging Details
.PP
This the kfocus packaging of the \f[V]qwe\f[R] utility.

git\[at]github.com/olafurw/qwe.
.SS Overview
.PP
The original concept and code was provided by Ã“lafur Waage.
This was refactored and enhanced by Michael Mikowski.
.PP
\f[V]qwe\f[R] has been adopted as a standard CLI utility for Kubuntu
Focus systems and is available with the kfocus-qwe package from their
ppa.
.SS Current Version
.PP
The current version is tested, stable, and has been marked as 1.0-0.
.SS Install
.PP
This kfocus-qwe package automatically installs a symlink from
\f[V]/usr/share/qwe/qwe.source\f[R] to
\f[V]/etc/bash_completion.d/qwe\f[R].
If qwe is not desired system-wide, one may delete this symlink and add
\f[V]source /usr/share/qwe/qwe.source\f[R] in .bashrc.
.PP
One can add qwe system-wide by adding a symlink from
\f[V]qwe.source\f[R] to \f[V]/etc/bash_completion.d/qwe\f[R].

.SS Other Notes
.PP
Type \f[V]qwe\f[R] alone to interactively select a directory.
.PP
Bookmarks are stored in a tab-delimited file called
\f[V]/.qwe.data\f[R].
The \f[V]$HOME\f[R] directory is parameterized so this file can be
shared by multiple users.
