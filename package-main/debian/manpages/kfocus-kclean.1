kfocus-kclean - Detect and uninstall unused/excessive Linux kernels
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]/usr/lib/kfocus/bin/kfocus-kclean\f[R] [-f|-h]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
kfocus-kclean helps with cleaning up unneeded Linux kernels.
It detects when space for kernels is getting low, determines which
kernels are most likely to be unused based on their type and version,
and offers to uninstall those older kernels.
By default, kfocus-kclean will exit and do nothing if free boot space is
sufficient.
It will only scan for and offer to remove kernels is space is low.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
-f
Forces a full kernel scan.
Kernels that can reasonably be purged are offered for uninstallation
even if they don\[cq]t need to be removed yet.
If no kernels can reasonably be purged, a summary of installed kernel
packages is shown along with a message that no kernels are to be
removed.
.TP
-h
Displays help.
