# Kubuntu Installer Prompt

This project is in beta. It presents a "Try or Install Kubuntu" screen. Eventually we want to extend this to support multiple flavors.

## Architecture

This section serves to explain how kubuntu-installer-prompt's various components work together to provide the Kubuntu ISO boot experience.

1. SDDM loads.
2. /etc/sddm.conf is read. This file has been generated (or modified?) by Casper to point to a kubuntu-live-environment.desktop X session.
3. kubuntu-live-environment.desktop executes /bin/start-kubuntu-live-env.
4. start-kubuntu-live-env starts kwin\_x11 and backgrounds it.
5. start-kubuntu-live-env starts /bin/kubuntu-installer-prompt but does not background it.
6. The installer prompt appears.
7. The user clicks "Install Kubuntu" or "Try Kubuntu".
8. If "Install Kubuntu" is clicked, the installer prompt executes `sudo -E calamares -D8`. The installer prompt then removes the buttons from the screen.
9. The installer window appears on the user's screen.
10. If Calamares closes, the installer prompt detects this and exits.
11. When the installer prompt exits, start-kubuntu-live-env kills kwin\_x11 and runs startplasma-x11.
12. If "Try Kubuntu" is clicked, steps 10 and 11 are executed immediately.

## Translations

Run the `gen_ts.sh` script after making any code modifications to ensure that the translations files are up-to-date for translators to work on.

To add a new language to be translated:

* Open the `gen_ts.sh` script and add the locale code for the new language to the `langList` array.
* Run the script after doing this - a new template .ts file will be generated under `src/translations/`.
* Next, add the new template file to the `TS_FILES` list in `CMakeLists.txt` - it will be named `src/translations/kubuntu-installer-prompt-locale_CODE.ts`, where `locale_CODE` is the locale code of the added language.
* Finally, add a line in the src/translations.qrc resource file to include the new translation file. The line should look like `<file alias="locale_CODE">kubuntu-installer-prompt_locale_CODE.qm</file>`, where `locale_CODE` is the locale code of the added language. This line should go inside the `<qresource>` tag.

For instance, if I were to add Chinese to the list of languages that could be translated into, I would do this:

    vim gen_ts.sh
    # add this code to the langList array:
    #    'zh_CN'
    ./gen_ts.sh
    vim CMakeLists.txt
    # add this line to the TS_FILES list:
    #    src/translations/kubuntu-installer-prompt_zh_CN.ts
    vim src/translations.qrc
    # add this line to the list of file resources:
    #    <file alias="zh_CN">kubuntu-installer-prompt_zh_CN.qm</file>

The program will now pick up the added language at build time. Any translations added to the newly created .ts file will be shown to program users who select the new language.
